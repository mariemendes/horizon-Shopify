# Shopify Horizon Theme
Development by: **Mariane Mendes**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
To preview the theme locally, run:
```sh
shopify theme dev --store=DR14WX-1Q
```
👉 When prompted for a password, go to your Shopify Admin:
**Online Store > Preferences > Password** to find it.

## ✅ After Finishing Your Work
* Make sure to **commit** all changes and **push** them to the repository.
* Always confirm you're working on the correct branch:
```bash
horizon-Shopify
```

At the end you have to push the theme/repository to the store, for that you can run:
```sh
shopify theme push
```
if it does not work, you can push directly by the admin by clicking into "Reset to lastest commit" -- but investigate first why your push dosn't work.
